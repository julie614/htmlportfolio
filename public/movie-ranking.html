<h1>Best Movies According to Julie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of this past decade</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>I know people are split on this pick, but I really enjoyed it and the soundtrack is great.</p>
<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are great in everything! I enjoyed the music and dancing. </p>
<h3>A Quiet Place</h3>
<p>I was afraid to see this movie for the jump scares, but it was great and so different from other sci-fi horror films.</p>
